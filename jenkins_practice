==================================================

 had this problem too but managed to solve it, the error is that ur computer has saved a git username and password so if you shift to another account the error 403 will appear. Below is the solution
For Windows you can find the keys here:

control panel > user accounts > credential manager > Windows credentials > Generic credentials

Next remove the Github keys.

====================================================


if you are using Tomcat. Update CATALINA_OPTS environment variable

export CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms16m -Xmx256m;

Jenkins is known to have issues with lag. You can speed up its performance by doing these 5 things:

Minimize amount of build on the master node
Prune your build history by using the “Discard Old Builds” feature
Clear old Jenkins data
Define the proper heap size and try to stay below 32 GB ===>> all the objects will store in heap area.when you run the code "stack area" will be create, requred values collect from heap area.

Tune the garbage collector ===> 

s1 = hareesh
s1 = mahesh

mahesh will be store in heap area, garbage collector removes hareesh from heap area because it is not assigned to any object.

JDK have JVM and JRE

JVM compile the code and converts into byte code and JRE run the byte code.
